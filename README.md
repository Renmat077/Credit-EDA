_**Problem Statement & Objective
****Problem Statement**

nonexistent credit history. Because of this, there are few defaulters. Finance company is failing to know if the
applicants are capable of repaying the loan or not.
**Objective**
To minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers by identifying pattern in the data which will
indicate if an applicant is a defaulter or not. This will ensure that the applicants who are capable of repaying
the loan are not rejected. Need to find the driving factors (variables) that are the strong indicators of default.
**Datasets used:**

whether a client has payment difficulties.
